## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a project I attempted when I first began my web development journey. The first attempt I ended up quitting momentarily because I didn't understand basic concepts like responsive design, positioning, units, and etc. I went back and studied these concepts and applied it to this project so it would be fully functioning and closely resemble the original design. I've learned a ton of HTML and CSS since my first attempt at this and I'm very proud at how the final result came out.

### Continued development

I added a transition that enlarges the cards when you hover over any one of them.
